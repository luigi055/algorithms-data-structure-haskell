Implementing Algorithms and Data structures in Haskell

## Project setup instructions:

### Install packages

```
stack install
```

### run tests
```
stack test
```

### Run tests in watch mode

```
stack test --file-watch
```

### Run tests in watch mode and coverage

```
stack test --file-watch --coverage
```

## Sort

Let's implement the sorting algorithms that are shown here: [https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
